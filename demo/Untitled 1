Assignment part 1:
================================================================

Create Spring boot app with rest APIs for-
•	Create author record
•	Fetch details of an author by author id
•	Fetching all authors
•	Fetch list of all books of an author
•	Fetch details of a book by author id and book id


Assignment part 2:
================================================================

1. Create authentication layer using UUID to sign on and sign off.
     - Use a static list or a cache library to save authenticated tokens.
     - Require an authenticated token in request header for all requests to your server.
2. Add input validation to existing endpoints.
3. Send correct http response codes. (ex. 400 for bad requests, 401 for users that are not authenticated.)
4. Follow REST architecture practices when creating uri paths.
5. Gracefully handle all exceptions.


Example/Notes:
1. use spring-boot-starter-security
2. create a hash map to store tokens.
3. pass some hardcoded tokens first.
4. hash map is a type of uuid.
5. at start - hash map will be available.
6. integrate authenticator using spring security.
7. create a custom service for authentication -> authService.
8. request -> header -> key will be auth-token -> 
9. call custom service with token as input -> authService .. get the hashmap -> check for key value exists or not.
10. hashmap.contains(key) = true -> user authenticated.....

11. spring boot security with custom authentication in rest api.

12. @Valid ... @Size(min=2...)
13. ResponseEntity.ok() ....

14. rest architecture - don't have two endpoints.
